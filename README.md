## Contributing
If you have questions about the contents of this repo, feel free to contact me.

We don't yet have a formal improvement proposal process, however do submit ideas for improvements to the protocol as issues in this repo.

If you spot an error, gap or useful clarification in one of the specs or papers, feel free to file an issue (or if it is small, submit a PR directly), and you may be listed as a contributor on the spec, if your issue is accepted ðŸ™‚.

Thank you!
